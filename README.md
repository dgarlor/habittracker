# habittracker

This is a small App, used mostly to explore the possibilities of Qt to create Mobile Apps and learn its use. 

## Description of the applicaton
The idea is simple, you can choose three habits you want to create in your life. 
The application will help you keep track of the times you manage to perform the habit.
Once a habit is done often and without effort, you can change of habit and go to the next one!

## Requirements
The application is written in Qt. So you have to set up you Qt enviroment to be able to use this code.

## Current status
The application is being started, so there are many critical fonctionalities not working yet... 
and it is going to take time because I'm not taking this to seriouly.
